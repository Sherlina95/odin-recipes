    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees
        C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Place squash, cut-side up, on the prepared
        baking sheet. Cover squash with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until squash is
        tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet
        over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic in the hot oil
        until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in a
        separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil
        until softened, about 5 minutes. Add spinach to onion; cook until
        spinach is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Heat 6 cups milk in a 5-quart saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until milk is simmering, about 5 minutes. Whisk remaining 1 cup milk and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; stir into simmering milk. Bring milk mixture to just under a boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and scraping bottom of pot to prevent scorching, until milk mixture has thickened into a sauce, about 5 minutes; remove pot from heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Whisk 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese, honey, nutmeg, sage, salt, and pepper into sauce until smooth. Cover pot with a lid and keep warm over low heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Scrape flesh from butternut squash into a bowl; stir with a fork until evenly mashed. Stir ginger, salt, and pepper into mashed butternut squash.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 11:</strong> Spoon about 1 cup white sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; arrange a layer of noodles atop white sauce. Layer 1/2 butternut squash mixture, 1/5 remaining white sauce, noodles, spinach mixture, 1/5 white sauce, noodles, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, mushroom mixture, 1/5 white sauce, noodles, remaining 1/2 butternut squash mixture, 1/5 the white sauce, remaining noodles, remaining 1/5 white sauce, remaining mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, respectively. Cover dish with aluminum foil and place dish on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 12:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake until bubbling and cheese is browned, about 15 more minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
