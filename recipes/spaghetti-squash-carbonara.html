    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I think this beautiful spaghetti squash carbonara is probably the most delicious way to eat spaghetti squash. I realize there’s not a lot of competition, since this isn’t the most exciting ingredient ever, but its blandness makes it a perfect pairing for classic carbonara ingredients. Plain spaghetti isn’t the most thrilling thing either, but when you add in eggs, freshly ground black pepper, pancetta, and lots of cheese, it becomes something magical, and the same thing happens here.</p>

    <p> Well, sort of the same thing. As I mentioned in the video, the only way to be disappointed with this recipe is to expect it to be just like actual spaghetti carbonara. Of course it’s not, and that's okay, since no matter what you call it, it’s a very delicious, and fairly nutritious thing to eat. So, as long as you manage those expectations, and promise not to cut off a finger, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
